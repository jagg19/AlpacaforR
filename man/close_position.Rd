\code{close_position} is deprecated. Use \code{\link[AlpacaforR]{positions}} with \code{action = "close"} instead. The close_positions function liquidates all positions or those specified by \code{ticker}. Character values are returned as a string while integer values are returned as numeric. See \href{https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/positions/}{Positions} for details.

The close all positions API liquidates all currently open long and short positions. Character values are returned as a string while integer values are returned as numeric.
